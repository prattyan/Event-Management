# 🚀 EventHorizon: The Future of Intelligent Event Management

## 🎯 Problem Statement (One Liner)
**Current event management relies on disconnected tools and manual processes, causing administrative chaos for organizers and a fragmented, high-friction experience for attendees.**

---

## 🚩 The Problem (Detailed)
In the fast-paced world of community gatherings and professional conferences, event management remains surprisingly fragmented and inefficient. Organizers and attendees struggle with significant friction points:

1.  **Fragmented Ecosystems**: Organizers juggle multiple mismatched tools for ticketing, promotion, team formation, and check-ins (e.g., Google Forms for data, WhatsApp for teams, Excel for tracking).
2.  **Chaos in Team Participation**: Hackathons and group events often suffer from "lone wolf" syndrome. Participants struggle to find teammates, creating a barrier to entry for team-based competitions.
3.  **The Check-in Bottleneck**: Physical events are plagued by long queues due to slow, manual registration verification processes.
4.  **Lack of Intelligence**: Event discovery is static. Users are bombarded with irrelevant events rather than personalized experiences based on their history and interests.
5.  **Disconnected Real-time Communication**: Last-minute venue changes or announcements often get lost in email inboxes, leading to confusion during the event.

## 💡 The Solution
**EventHorizon** is an all-in-one, intelligent event orchestration platform designed to bridge the gap between seamless digital management and physical engagement. It creates a unified ecosystem for organizers to host, and attendees to experience, events without the friction.

## 🌟 Uniqueness: How We Differ
Unlike generic ticketing platforms (like Eventbrite) or simple form builders (like Luma), EventHorizon is deeply integrated and "opinionated" about the event lifecycle:

1.  **AI-First vs. AI-Addon**: While others use AI for simple chatbots, we use Generative AI (Google Gemini) to *build* the event for you—auto-writing agendas, descriptions, and personalized invites to reduce organizer workload by 70%.
2.  **Native Team Formation**: Most platforms stop at individual tickets. We treat "Teams" as first-class citizens, allowing users to form, join, and manage groups *before* the event starts, solving the "lone wolf" problem inherent in hackathons.
3.  **integrated Velocity Scanning**: We don't rely on 3rd party scanner apps. Our PWA includes a purpose-built, millisecond-latency QR scanner that syncs instantly across co-organizer devices, eliminating entry queues.

## 🛠️ How It Solves The Problem
1.  **Eliminates Tool Fatigue**: By combining ticketing, team management, and check-in into one app, organizers no longer need to export CSVs between Google Forms and WhatsApp.
2.  **Removes Entry Friction**: The specialized scanner + QR system means check-ins take seconds, not minutes, ensuring events start on time.
3.  **Boosts Participation**: By making it easy to find teammates and personalized events, we directly address the "drop-off" between interest and actual attendance.

## 🧠 Google Technologies Used
We have leveraged the power of **Google Gemini (gemini-1.5-flash)** via the `GoogleGenerativeAI` SDK to infuse intelligence into the platform:

1.  **Content Generation (The "Creative Muse")**:
    *   **Problem**: Organizers often suffer from "writer's block" when creating event pages.
    *   **Solution**: We perform Prompt Engineering on `gemini-1.5-flash` to act as an expert copywriter. It generates engaging, tone-specific event descriptions and structured agendas from bare-bones inputs (Title + Date + Location).

2.  **Personalized Recommendation Engine**:
    *   **Problem**: Simple database queries cannot match users to events based on "vibes" or semantic interests.
    *   **Solution**: We feed a user's *past event history* and the *current event catalog* into Gemini as context. The model acts as a semantic matcher, returning a JSON array of event IDs that strictly match the user's inferred preferences.
